It's the beginnings of a WebAssembly compiler. I spent about three months
reading the specifications for binary format, making WebAssembly binaries
in a hex editor to be sure I really understood everything, and then as quickly
as I could I built a structure capable of holding everything and dumping it to
a file. It's a little messy right now. I don't think it will take all that
much time to clean it up and write the rest of the compiler from here. I got
pretty burnt out in the process so I took a break for a while and then spent
some time planning out the front end of things.
